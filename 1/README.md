# Ensign Assignment Part 1

Final code can be found in page.html and style.css.

## Layout Approaches Considered

During development, I evaluated two main layout strategies:

1. **Divs with Sections:**  
    This method provides greater flexibility for organizing content. However, I faced challenges ensuring each section maintained uniform height and width.

2. **CSS Grid:**  
    CSS Grid simplifies achieving consistent dimensions across sections, but I found it less flexible and more complex to adapt for my requirements.

## Final Choice

I opted for divs with sections due to their flexibility. To achieve uniformity, I clipped the content within each section, ensuring consistent width and height. The final output can be found in page.html and style.css.
